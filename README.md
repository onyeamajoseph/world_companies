🌍 World Top Companies – SQL Data Analysis Project
Welcome to the World Top Companies SQL Project, where i did dive deep into an analytical comparison of the world’s most powerful corporations based on Revenue, P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings), and Dividend Yield metrics.

This project explores trends, relationships, and insights using structured query language (SQL) and multiple datasets derived from Kaggle’s Largest Companies Analysis Worldwide.

📊 Project Objectives
The primary goals of this project are to:

Understand how major financial indicators like Revenue, P/E Ratio, and Dividend Yield relate across companies.

Perform relational joins across datasets to identify high-performing companies based on multiple financial KPIs.

Develop advanced SQL queries using CTEs, JOINS, and aggregate functions for business intelligence-style analysis.

Support data-driven decisions through high-impact insights about company performance across industries and countries.

🧩 Datasets Used
The project uses three key datasets, each representing a different financial perspective:

Companies Ranked by Revenue
Columns: Rank, Name, Revenue_Billion, Country, Industry

Companies Ranked by P/E Ratio
Columns: Rank, Name, Symbol, PE_Ratio_TTM, Price_GBP, Country

Companies Ranked by Dividend Yield
Columns: Rank, Name, Symbol, Dividend_Yield_TTM, Price_GBP, Country

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
SQL – For all data querying and analysis

MySQL  – Compatible SQL dialects

Kaggle Datasets – As the source of real-world financial data

GitHub – For project version control and collaboration

🔍 Key SQL Techniques Demonstrated
JOIN operations across related datasets

WITH clauses (Common Table Expressions)

GROUP BY and aggregation (e.g. AVG, COUNT, MAX)

Subqueries and filtering

Comparative and conditional logic (e.g. WHERE clauses using multiple conditions)

🔥 Highlighted Queries & Insights
Companies appearing in top 100 by revenue and dividend yield

High revenue companies with surprisingly low P/E ratios

Countries with the most dominant multinational performers

Identification of companies with outlier profitability or dividend policies

Comparative average metrics by industry and geography
